## Project

Smart Campus room availability checker; one room, fictional data.

## Constraints

Preserve these AC1–AC6:
- AC1: reject start >= end and past requests.
- AC2: reject durations longer than 120 minutes.
- AC3: reject a blocked room.
- AC4: reject overlaps; allow bookings touching only at endpoints.
- AC5–AC6: do not mutate booking data; retain clear

desktop/mobile feedback.
no backend, login, or booking creation.


## Engineering rules

Prefer pure functions and minimal changes; use at most 2 justified patterns.
Do not mutate booking fixtures; keep responsive UI feedback.

## Verification

Run existing tests and add focused regression tests.
Report changed files, rationale, and test evidence.
